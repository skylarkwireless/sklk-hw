![IRIS-EXT-04-BRK Board Rev AA Product Image](/Iris-EXT-04-BRK/images/IRIS-EXT-04-BRK-Top-800x800.png)

MIMO bus breakout board for the IRIS-030 SDR platform. With breakout for both upstream and downstream MIMO connectors, the IRIS-EXT-04-BRK allows construction of unique clocking, data, and testing topologies.
The IRIS-EXT-04-BRK provides a starting point for developing custom modular components that connect to an Iris-030 software-defined radio platform and either communicate on or are powered by the Iris MIMO bus.
Project developed and packaged with Altium Designer 20.0.11.
