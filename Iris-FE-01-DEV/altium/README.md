# Iris-FE-01-DEV Altium Design Project

The Iris-FE-01-DEV PCB incorporates an I2C LED controller and directly-connected GPIO to control TDD/FDD and Tx/Rx switching for each of two RF channels. Please see the switching diagram and circuit schematic in "/doc" for more information.

This design has been manufactured and validated.

## Project
The important directory contents are as follows:
         
      IRIS-FE-01-B.PrjPCB                  - Top-level Altium Designer PCB Project

      IRIS-FE.OutJob                       - Altium output generation script
	  
## Quick-start Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
1. Install Altium Designer on your machine. You must have a valid license and must use a version greater than 17.1.6.
1. Open the \*.PrjPCB document. This will open all project documents.
1. In the *Projects* tab, expand and double-click on the \*.OutJob. On the right-hand side of the GUI that appears, generate the various outputs. This will produce Gerbers and additional documention in a new */Outputs/* folder in the project directory.

Good luck!
