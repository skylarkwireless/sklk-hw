## Contents


The directory structure is as follows:
         
      stl/                      - stl files for printing or manufacturing
	  
      step/                     - 3d step files for printing or manufacturing
	  
	  images/                   - 3D Renders and photos of the finished design

## Use
	This enclosure design is to protect the IRIS-030 and IRIS-FE-01-DEV from minor accidental damage and shorting of components. It is provided in both step and stl format to allow for printing or manufacturing. 
	It has been tested on a CR10s and MakerBot Replicator 2.
	Settings can be fairly low on either printer, 0.2mm with 25% infill works well as long as enough shell layers are used.
	For post processing, it is recommended to use a 3/32 bit to bore out the friction fit posts holes and a 7/16 bit to drill out the alignment hole.
	Friction pins are 3/32 in size and available from McMaster-Carr part number 98381A436. 6 are used per enclosure. two in the top cover and 4 in the bottom cover. They should by glued in place.
	The LED shrouds can have 1/8" acrylic rod cut and inserted to act as light pipes. It is recommended that they be glued in place. These rods are available from McMaster-Carr part number 8531K11.
	The fan should be a 3 pin 30x30x10mm fan mounted with No 6 thread forming screws McMaster-Carr part number 96068A153. 
	A small low clearance heatsink should be installed on the Xilinx Zynq Chip.
